---

## Executive Summary

The AI Project Manager is an intelligent oversight feature that acts as a virtual project manager within VendorConnect. It autonomously monitors project health, task completion, checklist progress, user engagement patterns, and identifies potential issues across all active projects. Using OpenAI's language models, it provides natural language insights, proactive recommendations, and automated status reports to Admin users through both a dedicated dashboard section and weekly email digests.

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL PREREQUISITE:** VendorConnect currently does **NOT** collect most of the data needed for enhanced monitoring features (task views, rejections, platform usage patterns, historical baselines). **Phase 0 (3 weeks) must build this tracking infrastructure first** before the AI can analyze it. See Section 5.1 for details.

**Phase 2 Enhancement:** AI-powered follow-up email generator that allows admins to select detected issues, automatically generate professional follow-up emails, customize content, and send to team members - saving 15+ minutes per follow-up.

### Key Value Proposition
- **Proactive Issue Detection**: Identifies 24+ issue types including rejected tasks, low engagement, velocity decline, and blocker keywords (NLP) before they become critical
- **Automated Oversight**: Reduces manual project monitoring overhead for admins by 70%
- **Smart Compliance Checker**: Automated QA ensures checklists complete, attachments uploaded, and subtasks finished before marking done
- **Intelligent Insights**: Leverages AI to surface patterns, compare to historical averages, and provide actionable recommendations
- **Enhanced Accountability**: Per-person heat map with individual performance metrics, on-time rates, and workload visibility
- **Automated Nudges**: Gentle email reminders sent directly to team members for overdue tasks, approaching deadlines, and unopened assignments
- **Executive Visibility**: Provides high-level overview with positive/negative signals and deep-dive capabilities
- **Smart Follow-Up (Phase 2)**: Generate personalized follow-up emails with AI in seconds instead of writing manually

### Enhanced Monitoring Capabilities

The AI Project Manager monitors a comprehensive set of signals to provide complete project visibility:

**üìä Traditional Project Metrics:**
- Task completion rates and deadline adherence
- Checklist completion percentages
- Priority distribution and deliverables

**üë§ User Engagement Metrics:**
- **Task Rejection Tracking** - Who's rejecting tasks and why
- **Task View Engagement** - Tasks assigned but never opened by users
- **Platform Usage Patterns** - Login frequency, time on platform, activity trends
- **Response Time Analysis** - How quickly users engage with assigned tasks

**üìà Advanced Analytics:**
- **Historical Comparisons** - Project duration vs. historical averages (detect slowdowns)
- **Velocity Tracking** - Task completion pace and momentum trends
- **Progression Indicators** - Actual work progress vs. time elapsed
- **Communication Analysis** - Team engagement through comments and updates

**üö¶ Positive & Negative Signals:**
- ‚úÖ **Positive:** Ahead of schedule, high engagement, proactive updates, consistent velocity
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Negative:** Declining activity, missed deadlines, low engagement, task abandonment, stalled projects

This holistic approach ensures admins catch issues early and recognize what's working well.

## Problem Statement

### Current Challenges
1. **Manual Oversight Burden**: Admins must manually review multiple projects to identify issues
2. **Delayed Problem Detection**: Issues may go unnoticed until they become critical
3. **Scattered Information**: Project health indicators are spread across multiple views
4. **Reactive Management**: System lacks proactive alerting for at-risk projects
5. **Limited Intelligence**: No automated analysis of project patterns or trends
6. **Time-Intensive Reporting**: Creating status summaries requires manual data aggregation

### User Pain Points
- "I don't have time to check every project daily to see if tasks are on track"
- "By the time I notice a project is behind, we've already missed the deadline"
- "I wish I had a weekly summary of what needs my attention"
- "It's hard to spot patterns across multiple projects without manual analysis"

---

## Goals & Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. Provide automated, intelligent project oversight across the entire VendorConnect workspace
2. Reduce admin time spent on manual project status monitoring by 70%
3. Increase early detection of at-risk projects by 80%
4. Deliver actionable insights that improve project completion rates

### Success Metrics
- **Adoption**: 80% of admins actively use AI Project Manager dashboard within 3 months
- **Email Engagement**: 60% open rate on weekly AI PM email reports
- **Issue Detection**: AI identifies and flags issues 2-3 days earlier than current manual process
- **Time Savings**: Admins report 5+ hours saved per week on project monitoring
- **Project Health**: 15% improvement in on-time task completion rate

### Non-Goals (Out of Scope for v1.0)
- AI will not automatically take actions (only recommend actions)
- AI will not directly communicate with Taskers or Requesters
- AI will not create or modify tasks/projects automatically
- AI will not provide real-time chat interface (future consideration)

| **Owner Assignment** | High-priority tasks must have at least one assigned owner | Flag as "Unassigned Critical Task" |
| **Blocker Resolution** | Tasks with blocker keywords in recent comments should not be marked complete | Flag as "Blocker Keywords Detected" |
| **Deliverable Count** | If task specifies `deliverable_quantity`, that many deliverables must be uploaded | Flag as "Missing Deliverables" |

**Implementation:**

```php
// Pseudo-code for compliance check
function checkTaskCompliance(Task $task): array
{
    $violations = [];
    
    // Check 1: Checklist completion
    if ($task->hasIncompleteChecklists()) {
        $violations[] = [
            'type' => 'incomplete_checklist',
            'severity' => 'high',
            'message' => 'Task has incomplete checklist items'
        ];
    }
    
    // Check 2: Required attachments
    if ($task->requiresAttachments() && $task->attachments()->count() === 0) {
        $violations[] = [
            'type' => 'missing_attachments',
            'severity' => 'medium',
            'message' => 'Task marked as requiring attachments but none uploaded'
        ];
    }
    
    // Check 3: Subtask completion
    if ($task->childTasks()->incomplete()->count() > 0) {
        $violations[] = [
            'type' => 'incomplete_subtasks',
            'severity' => 'high',
            'message' => 'Parent task has ' . $task->childTasks()->incomplete()->count() . ' incomplete subtasks'
        ];
    }
    
    // Check 4: Owner assignment
    if ($task->priority->is_high && $task->users()->count() === 0) {
        $violations[] = [
            'type' => 'no_owner',
            'severity' => 'critical',
            'message' => 'High-priority task has no assigned owner'
        ];
    }
    
    // Check 5: Blocker keywords (NLP)
    $blockerKeywords = ['blocked', 'waiting', 'stuck', 'can\'t proceed', 'need help'];
    $recentComments = $task->messages()->recent(7)->pluck('body')->join(' ');
    foreach ($blockerKeywords as $keyword) {
        if (stripos($recentComments, $keyword) !== false) {
            $violations[] = [
                'type' => 'blocker_detected',
                'severity' => 'high',
                'message' => "Recent comments contain blocker keyword: '{$keyword}'"
            ];
            break;
        }
    }
    
    // Check 6: Deliverable count
    if ($task->deliverable_quantity && $task->deliverables()->count() < $task->deliverable_quantity) {
        $violations[] = [
            'type' => 'insufficient_deliverables',
            'severity' => 'medium',
            'message' => 'Expected ' . $task->deliverable_quantity . ' deliverables, found ' . $task->deliverables()->count()
        ];
    }
    
    return $violations;
}
```

**User Experience:**

When admin or user attempts to mark task/project as complete:
1. Run compliance check
2. If violations found:
   - Show modal with list of violations
   - Prevent status change (for critical/high violations)
   - Allow override with admin confirmation
3. Log violation attempt for AI analysis

**AI Integration:**

Compliance violations feed into AI analysis:
- "Project XYZ has 3 tasks with compliance issues"
- "Team consistently forgets to upload attachments (5 instances this week)"
- "Pattern detected: Design tasks marked complete before client approval uploaded"

#### 3.4 Automated Nudges to Team Members **NEW**
**Priority:** P1 (High)

**Description:**  
Automated reminder emails sent directly to team members (not just admin) for overdue or approaching tasks. Acts as a gentle accountability mechanism.

**Nudge Types:**

| Nudge Type | Trigger | Recipient | Frequency | Tone |
|------------|---------|-----------|-----------|------|
| **Overdue Task Reminder** | Task 1+ days overdue | Task assignee(s) | Daily (max 1 per day) | Professional, direct |
| **Upcoming Deadline** | Task due in 24-48 hours | Task assignee(s) | Once | Friendly reminder |
| **Checklist Incomplete** | Checklist <50% complete, deadline in 3 days | Task assignee(s) | Once | Helpful nudge |
| **Unopened Task Alert** | Task assigned 3+ days ago, never viewed | Task assignee(s) | Once | Gentle prompt |
| **Blocker Follow-Up** | Blocker keyword detected 3+ days ago, no update | Task assignee(s) + creator | Once | Supportive |

**Email Template Examples:**

**Overdue Task Reminder:**
```
Subject: Reminder: Your VendorConnect Task "{Task Title}" is Overdue

Hi {First Name},

This is a friendly reminder that your task is currently overdue:

üìã Task: {Task Title}
üìÅ Project: {Project Name}
üìÖ Due Date: {End Date} (overdue by {X} days)
üîó View Task: {Task URL}

If you're facing any blockers or need support, please update the task or reach out to your project manager.

Thanks,
VendorConnect AI Assistant
```

**Upcoming Deadline:**
```
Subject: Reminder: Task "{Task Title}" Due Tomorrow

Hi {First Name},

Quick heads up - your task is due soon:

üìã Task: {Task Title}
üìÅ Project: {Project Name}
üìÖ Due Date: {End Date} (in {X} hours)
‚úÖ Checklist: {Y}% complete
üîó View Task: {Task URL}

You're doing great! Just a reminder to wrap this up before the deadline.

Thanks,
VendorConnect AI Assistant
```

**Unopened Task Alert:**
```
Subject: Action Needed: Task "{Task Title}" Awaiting Your Attention

Hi {First Name},

You were assigned a task {X} days ago that hasn't been opened yet:

üìã Task: {Task Title}
üìÅ Project: {Project Name}
üìÖ Due Date: {End Date}
üîó View Task: {Task URL}

Please review the task details and let us know if you have questions or concerns.

Thanks,
VendorConnect AI Assistant
```

**Blocker Follow-Up:**
```
Subject: Follow-up: Can We Help with "{Task Title}"?

Hi {First Name},

We noticed your task has been flagged as blocked for {X} days:

üìã Task: {Task Title}
üìÅ Project: {Project Name}
üöß Blocker: {Detected keyword/phrase}
üîó View Task: {Task URL}

Is there anything we can do to help unblock this? Please update the task or reach out if you need support.

Thanks,
VendorConnect AI Assistant
```

**Configuration Settings:**

Admins can configure:
- **Enable/Disable Nudges** - Global on/off switch
- **Nudge Frequency** - How often to send (daily, every 2 days, weekly)
- **Exclude Users** - Specific users who don't want automated reminders
- **Exclude Projects** - Projects where nudges shouldn't be sent
- **Overdue Threshold** - How many days overdue before sending reminder
- **Tone Preference** - Professional / Friendly / Direct
- **Include Admin in CC** - Whether to CC admin on team member nudges

**Opt-Out Mechanism:**

Users can opt-out of nudges:
- Click "Unsubscribe from task reminders" in email footer
- Update notification preferences in user settings
- Admins can still see all nudges that would have been sent (in dashboard)

**Tracking & Analytics:**

Track nudge effectiveness:
- Nudges sent per user per week
- Task completion rate after nudge (did it help?)
- Nudge-to-action time (how long after nudge was task completed?)
- Opt-out rate
- Bounce/undeliverable rate

**Database Schema Addition:**

```sql
ALTER TABLE notifications ADD COLUMN nudge_type VARCHAR(50) NULL;
ALTER TABLE notifications ADD COLUMN nudge_sent_to_user_id BIGINT UNSIGNED NULL;
ALTER TABLE notifications ADD COLUMN parent_issue_id BIGINT UNSIGNED NULL;

CREATE INDEX idx_nudge_tracking ON notifications(nudge_type, nudge_sent_to_user_id, created_at);
```

**Implementation Notes:**

- Nudges are generated by AI analysis engine when issues detected
- Queued for delivery (don't send immediately - batch by user)
- Check user preferences before sending
- Log all nudges (sent or suppressed) for reporting
- Admin can preview nudges before they're sent (optional approval workflow)

**Integration with Phase 2 Follow-Up Emails:**

Nudges are **automatic**, while Phase 2 follow-up emails are **admin-initiated**:
- **Nudges**: System sends directly to team members (autopilot)
- **Follow-Up Emails**: Admin selects issues, customizes message, then sends

Both use same tracking infrastructure but serve different purposes.

### 5. Data Models & Storage

#### 5.1 Database Schema

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Data Collection Prerequisites**  

**Current State Analysis:**
VendorConnect currently collects:
- ‚úÖ User `last_login_at` timestamps
- ‚úÖ Basic `activity_logs` (CRUD operations)
- ‚úÖ Task assignment history
- ‚úÖ Task timestamps (created_at, updated_at)

**Required Data Collection (Must Build FIRST):**

To support the enhanced AI monitoring features, the following tracking capabilities **MUST BE IMPLEMENTED** before the AI Project Manager can analyze them:

| Feature | What's Needed | Implementation Approach | Estimated Effort |
|---------|--------------|------------------------|------------------|
| **Task Engagement Tracking** | Log when users view/open tasks | New table: `task_views` (task_id, user_id, viewed_at) + Frontend tracking event | 2-3 days |
| **Task Rejection Tracking** | Track rejected tasks and reasons | New status or table: `task_rejections` (task_id, user_id, reason, rejected_at) | 2-3 days |
| **Platform Usage Metrics** | Session duration and activity time | New table: `user_sessions` (user_id, login_at, logout_at, duration_seconds) + Middleware tracking | 3-4 days |
| **Historical Project Baselines** | Aggregate average project durations | One-time script + ongoing tracking: Calculate avg duration by project type/client | 2-3 days |
| **User Task Activity** | Last activity timestamp per task | Add `task_user.last_activity_at` column + update on any task interaction | 1-2 days |
| **Comment Activity Indexing** | Queryable comment timestamps | Index existing `ch_messages.created_at` by task_id (may already exist) | 1 day |

**Total Pre-Work Estimate:** 2-3 weeks of backend development

**Implementation Priority for Data Collection:**

**Phase 0 (Pre-AI PM - Weeks 1-3):**
1. **Week 1:** Task view tracking + Comment indexing
2. **Week 2:** Task rejection tracking + User task activity timestamps
3. **Week 3:** Platform usage metrics + Historical baselines calculation

**Alternative Approach:**
- Start with **limited AI PM v1.0** using only currently available data
- Add enhanced features in **v1.1-v1.3** as new tracking becomes available

**Recommendation:**  
Begin data collection **immediately** even if AI PM isn't deployed yet. This builds historical data that makes the AI analysis more valuable from day 1.

### 21. Success Stories & Use Cases

#### Use Case 1: Preventing Project Failure

**Scenario:**  
A video production project has 3 tasks overdue and the deadline is in 2 days. The assigned tasker hasn't logged in for 5 days.

**AI PM Action:**
- Detects issue during scheduled analysis
- Flags as **Critical** severity
- Sends immediate alert email to admin
- Recommends: "Reassign tasks to team member with capacity, extend deadline, or contact tasker urgently"

**Outcome:**  
Admin sees alert, immediately contacts tasker (who had forgotten), reassigns one task, and extends deadline by 2 days. Project completes successfully with only minor delay.

**Value:** Prevented complete project failure and client dissatisfaction.

---

#### Use Case 2: Resource Reallocation

**Scenario:**  
Weekly report shows that 3 users have 8+ active tasks each while 2 other users have only 1-2 tasks.

**AI PM Action:**
- Identifies resource imbalance in weekly analysis
- Flags as **Medium** severity
- Recommendation: "Consider redistributing tasks from overloaded users to underutilized team members"

**Outcome:**  
Admin reviews workload distribution, reassigns 5 tasks to underutilized users, improving overall team velocity by 20%.

**Value:** Optimized team capacity and reduced burnout risk.

---

#### Use Case 3: Pattern Recognition

**Scenario:**  
AI detects that design tasks consistently take 30% longer than estimated across multiple projects.

**AI PM Action:**
- Identifies trend over 4-week period
- Flags as **Low** severity (informational)
- Recommendation: "Adjust time estimates for design tasks to improve planning accuracy"

**Outcome:**  
Admin updates task templates to reflect realistic design timelines, improving future project forecasting.

**Value:** Better planning and more accurate client commitments.

# Smart API Environment Variable Fix

## Issue
Smart API was returning "No users found" because environment variables weren't being loaded in the web environment (PHP-FPM), even though they worked in CLI.

## Root Cause
Laravel's web environment (PHP-FPM) doesn't automatically load `.env` file variables in production, causing the Smart API to fail when making internal HTTP requests.

## Solution Applied
1. **Added environment variables to PHP-FPM configuration**:
   ```bash
   echo 'env[SMART_API_KEY] = your_smart_api_key_here' >> /etc/php/8.3/fpm/pool.d/www.conf
   echo 'env[OPENAI_API_KEY] = your_openai_api_key_here' >> /etc/php/8.3/fpm/pool.d/www.conf
   systemctl restart php8.3-fpm
   ```

2. **Modified Smart API to use environment variables directly**:
   - Changed from `config('app.smart_api_key')` to `env('SMART_API_KEY')`
   - This ensures API keys are loaded even if config caching has issues

## Files Modified
- `/etc/php/8.3/fpm/pool.d/www.conf` - Added environment variables
- `app/Http/Controllers/Api/SmartTaskController.php` - Changed to use `env()` directly

## Verification Commands
```bash
# Test environment variables are loaded
curl -s 'https://app.businessnet.com/test_env.php' | jq .

# Test Smart API functionality
curl -s -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'X-API-Key: vck_IuYqGalsAzWt6TP8y2eg0ZhRj3sJNekU8lonoOtI' -d '{"action":"get_users","params":{}}' 'https://app.businessnet.com/api/v1/smart-task' | jq .
```

## Prevention
- Always verify environment variables are loaded in web environment after deployment
- Use PHP-FPM environment variables for critical API keys
- Add health checks to monitor Smart API functionality
- Document all environment variable requirements

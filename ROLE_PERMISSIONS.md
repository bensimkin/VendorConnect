## Notification System by Role

### Tasker

## Best Practices

### Role Assignment
1. **Start with Tasker:** Assign this role to external workers and contractors
2. **Use Requester for Clients:** Give this role to clients who need to request work
3. **Delegate with Sub Admin:** Use for team leads and project managers
4. **Limit Admin Access:** Reserve for system administrators only

### Security Considerations
- Regularly review role assignments
- Remove access when users leave projects
- Monitor user activity for unusual patterns
- Keep sensitive information restricted to necessary roles only

### Workflow Optimization
- **Requesters** create tasks and assign to **Taskers**
- **Taskers** complete work and upload deliverables
- **Requesters** review and approve deliverables
- **Admins/Sub Admins** oversee the entire process

## Migration and Updates

When updating user roles:
1. Consider the user's current responsibilities
2. Ensure they have appropriate access for their needs
3. Test access levels after role changes
4. Update any automated processes that depend on role-based access

## Support and Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Access Denied:** Check if user has appropriate role for the action
- **Missing Data:** Verify role permissions for data visibility
- **Notification Issues:** Ensure role has notification access

### Role Management
- Only Admins can assign roles
- Users can have only one role at a time
- Role changes take effect immediately
- Previous role permissions are completely removed when changed
